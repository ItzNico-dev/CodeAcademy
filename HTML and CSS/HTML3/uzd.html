            Robert Nesta Marley OM (6 February 1945 to 11 May 1981; baptised in
            1980 as Berhane Selassie) was a Jamaican singer, musician, and
            songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical
            career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady,
            as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's
            contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music
            worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture to this
            day. Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a
            Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of
            spirituality. He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican
            music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his
            outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[citation needed] In
            1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which
            was thought to be politically motivated. He also supported
            legalization of marijuana, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.
