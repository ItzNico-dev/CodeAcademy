//? Create a simple to-do list application using JavaScript 
//? and local storage.





//? The application should have the following features:




//? 1. A form for adding new to-do items to the list.




//? 2. A display area for showing all the items on the list.





//? 3. A button for clearing the entire list.





//? 4. Use local storage to save the to-do list so that it persists 
//? even when the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.




//? Instructions:

//? 1. Create an HTML file with a form for adding new to-do items.
//?Â The form should have a text input and a button for submitting the item.

//? 2. Create a JavaScript file to handle the logic for the to-do list application.

//? 3. Use the localStorage object to save the to-do list to the user's browser.

//? 4. When the page loads, check if there is a saved to-do list in local storage
//? and display it if there is.

//? 5. When the user submits a new item, add it to the list and update the local storage.

//? 6. Add a button that allows the user to clear the entire list and clears the local storage.
