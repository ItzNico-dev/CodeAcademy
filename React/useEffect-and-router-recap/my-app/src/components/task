Use a public news API, such as NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/), to fetch news articles for different categories (e.g., technology, sports, entertainment, etc.).


Create a navigation bar with links to different news categories. Use React Router to set up routes for each category.


Create a Category component that will display a list of articles for the selected category. The component should use the useEffect hook to fetch the articles for the given category whenever the category changes.


Create an Article component that will display the article's title, image, description, and a link to read the full article on its original source.
Use CSS or styled-components


(Optional) Add pagination or infinite scrolling to load more articles as the user scrolls down.
